			Change armor formula. Armors will only take damage only if hit by armor piercing weapons or critical hits or if affected by armor reduction debuff. Unlike in DotA, armor reduction debuff is permanent because armor reduction is actually armor destruction. <BR>
			Change weapon formula. Weapons will only get deteriorated with repeated usage over time, taking almost negligible deterioration for normal attacks but significant deterioration if the armor it strikes absorbs all the damage or if the armor has a damage reduction debuff, that is, if the armor is much stronger than the weapon. <BR>
